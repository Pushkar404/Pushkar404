- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pushkar404
- 👀 I’m interested in **breaking and sometimes fixing code.**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **C, Flask, and how not to rage quit debugging.**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **cool projects that don’t make me question my life choices.**
- 📫 How to reach me **Raise an issue here or summon me with a well-placed printf().**
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him (or just "Bhai" works fine)**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **90% of my coding time is spent fixing what I broke in the first 10%.**
